Handler
-----------

Every main thread or the UI thread  has a message queue. Message queue has all the events to this thread. It can have messages or runnables. We can post a runnable or messasge to this thread using a  Handler to the message queue.
In the splash screen intially we used a thread and loaded the fragments from the thread context. We later changed that to Handler as we wanted to load the fragments from the UI thread context. 

Handler = new Handler( new Runnable {
		//Implement the Run method

})

we can also use the postDelayed method to process a message or runnable at a later point of time


Runnable is a interface and the thread class implements that method.
